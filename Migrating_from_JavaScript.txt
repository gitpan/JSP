Migrating code written for JavaScript.pm to JSP

= Exception Handling

JSP and Jackobsson's JavaScript module differ on how they throw exceptions:

In JavaScript, when an error occurred inside javascript code (and was not
trapped by a C<try ... catch>), the operation returned C<undef> and C<$@> was
set. But this can lead to unnoticed errors.

In JSP the handling of exceptions uses a more regular mechanism.
Errors in both languages always throw exceptions. Period.

As this is an incompatible change, if you have code that depends on the
previous behaviour, you can revert to it by setting context's option
C<RaiseExceptions> to a FALSE value. Please see L<JSP::Context/RaiseEceptions>.


= PerlArray and PerlHash classes

JSP's classes PerlArray and PerlHash have a class property: $construct_blessed.
You can set it to a TRUE value to turn on the Claes's JavaScript compatibility
mode.

This affect the behavior of the javascript C<PerlArray> constructor because
when the PerlArray instance constructed in this mode arrives to perl space
it will be a C<JSP::PerlArray> instance, not a very useful thing.

If in some other place of your code you need to known if legacy support mode is
active or modify it, you can:

    if($JSP::PerlArray::construct_blessed) {
	# In legacy support mode
	# Turns it off;
	local $JSP::PerlArray::construct_blessed = undef;
	# Now you can call js code that creates perl arrays with out worry
	...
    }

As this is an interim back compatibility feature, we strongly recommend you to
port your code, and forget about instances of C<JSP::PerlArray> in perl.
